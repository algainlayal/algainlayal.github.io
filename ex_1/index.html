      <h3>Funny lunch</h3>
        <p>The restaurant’s menu had always been standard diner food: lots of grease and eggs and french fries.However, he still wanted cocktail sauce.One morning my partner and I went out for an early lunch (okay, maybe it was brunch) at a local diner franchise.However, they were in the midst of phasing in a new menu with “local fare” and “healthy options”, things like bison burgers made from grass fed bison and whole grain buns.That meal, all we heard about was fucking shrimp cocktails, and also cocktail sauce.
      The new menu did not have a shrimp cocktail.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>chocolate cake</li>
      <li>pink crackers</li>
      <li>sweet chips</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Exquisite taste buds</h3>
        <p>I had been working at Chipotle for just over two hours when I encountered one of the most clueless women I’ve ever met in my life. This was in 2011, so Chipotle was already a massive and well-known corporation in the USA. Uhh...Soup? I wasn’t expecting that. Before getting hired I’d eaten at Chipotle many times, and knew for g the benefit of the doubt, just in case that was a test-market Chipotle or there had been a menu addition. Nothing. “I’m sorry ma’am we don’t. They reached the door and I was trying to process the interaction I just had, when she turned back and yelled “You really shouldn’t call it a bowl if you aren’t going to put soup in it!”</p>
        <ol>
          <li>carrots</li>
          <li>corn</li>
          <li>cabbage</li>
        </ol>

      <h3>Yummy in my tummy</h3>
        <p>It was a nice, if kind of sterile place, the kind of place that attracted ‘New money’ rather than old. was in my 20s, playing in a jazz trio at a local Club Corp. club, which took up the penthouse floor of a high-rise building in a Southern US city.Rarely.
        As I recall, one of the guy’s kids left a big tip for the wait staff, since Mr. Big Shot refused to leave a dime.
        The manager smiled at me and mouthed the words “Well-played!” and withdrew.Case in point, one evening the waiters put together a banquet table.</p>
