				<h1>About<br>Her.</h1>
					
					<h2><span class="italic">Eezmah</span> is a fashion design graduate with a passion for art and illustration.</h2>
					
					<p>While studying fashion design for her undergraduate studies, the classes and projects that she enjoyed most were the ones that involved illustration and drawing. For her senior collection, she worked on a concept that merged art with fashion; which inspired her to focus on being an artist. <br>She hopes to touch and inspire the hearts of others through her artworks and illustrations.</p>
				<br>
				<h2> <span class="italic">Her</span> journey</h2>	
					<p>As a young girl, Eezmah was always fascinated with the magical cartoon characters created by Walt Disney and Tim Burton.<br>Today, her main sources of inspiration are the characters that she used to love as a child, such as Cruella de Vil, the Corpse Bride, Rugrats and Yzma from the Emperors New Groove. Through her own unique vision, she transforms the characteristics that she loves about her favorite cartoons and makes them her own. She has recently started drawing Arabian characters, hoping to influence Arabs to cherish their arabian roots, and introduce the western world to the beautiful Arabian culture and their traditions in a fresh way.</p>

				<h2>A comment from the <span class="italic">artist</span></h2>
					<p>"As a fashion designer my passion lies in art and illustration. My participation in "Iftar Sayem" during Ramadan has helped me value the simple pleasures of life. We were distributing meals in Aljamaa district, and the children that live there were very appreciative to gestures such as "How are you?" or "I've missed you". The simplest greetings made them immediately smile. 
					One day while we were waiting for all the teams to finish distributing the meals to the families in the neighborhood, I picked up a notebook and started sketching one of the young girls that I grew fond of. The sketch was quick and simple and I drew her as a cartoon character. The sketch made her feel happy and special. She hugged me and it felt great to be able to brighten someone's day"-z</p>
				<h2>What inspired <span class="italic">her</span></h3>	 
					<p>"At that moment, a wonderful idea occurred to me and I asked the team leader if it was okay to start sketching the rest of the kids. The team leader thought it was a great idea! The next day I got some empty papers and a marker and started to draw some of the other kids in Aljamaa district. I posted it on my snapchat and Instagram account, and the feedback that I received was incredible. The concept was simple but everyone was in love with it. 
					I decided that I wanted to come up with a social campaign that helps spread love, kindness and compassion. So I created the hashtag #drawasmilewitheezmah. Eezmah is my art and illustration blog that I've started a couple of months ago. I want to use my blog to give exposure to this social campaign. By creating stories through my illustrations and sketches I hope to give people simple ideas on how to make others smile and feel happy"-z</p>
